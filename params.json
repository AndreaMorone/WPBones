{"name":"WB Bones","tagline":"WordPress library","body":"### Welcome to WP Bones.\r\nWPBones is a library that provides a lot of tools and rules in order to write a WordPress plugin and theme.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirement\r\nWP Bones has a few system requirements. However, if you are a newbie in composer, npm, laravel and gulp, please, visit​ the related web site before continue.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nFirst, download the WPKirk boilerplate.\r\nYou can use either git command line or github for mac application. You can download the develop or release version:\r\n\r\nDevelop\r\n\r\n    $ git clone -b develop https://github.com/gfazioli/WPKirk.git <your plugin name>\r\n\r\nMaster release\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/gfazioli/WPKirk.git <your plugin name>\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\n    $ cd <your plugin name>\r\n    $ php bones install\r\n\r\nEnter you plugin name or namespace\r\n\r\n    $ php bones\r\n\r\nThen you will see\r\n\r\n    Bones Version 0.1.3\r\n\r\n     Usage:\r\n\r\n\tcommand [options] [arguments]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce downloaded, follow the instruction in the README file.\r\n\r\n### Naming Your Application\r\n\r\nAfter installing WPKirk, you may wish to \"name\" your plugin. By default, the plugin directory is namespaced under WPKirk, and autoloaded by Composer using the [PSR-4 autoloading standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/). However, you may change the namespace to match the name of your application, which you can easily do via the `namespace` Bones command.\r\n\r\nFor example, at beginning, the plugin is named \"WPKirk\", you could run the following command from the root of your installation:\r\n\r\n    php bones namespace WPMyAwesomePlugin\r\n\r\nOf course, renaming your plugin is not optional.\r\n\r\n# Tutorials\r\n\r\n## Boilerplate\r\n\r\nIf you would like to write a WordPress plugin with WPBones library, you can use the WPKirk boilerplate.\r\n\r\n# The Basics\r\n\r\n## Menus\r\n## Actions and filters\r\n\r\n# Services\r\n\r\n## Bones Console\r\n\r\nBones is also the name of the command-line interface included with WPKirk boilerplate. It provides a number of helpful commands for your use while developing your plugin. You will use bone command-line interface for start your develop. First of all, try the command-line console by run:\r\n\r\n    $ php bones\r\n\r\nThen, you can change the plugin namespace from WPKirk to MyFirstWPBonesPlugin, for example:\r\n\r\n    $php bones namespace MyFirstWPBonesPlugin\r\n\r\nAwesome! You are quite ready to start to ​develop.\r\n\r\n## Views\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
